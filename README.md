# Security.nl News Scraper

A Python script that scrapes the latest news from [security.nl](https://www.security.nl/) and generates a well-structured HTML page containing the news items. The script leverages the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library for parsing the HTML source code of the website.

The generated HTML page showcases the following details for each news item:

- Date and time
- Title
- Link to the article

The script automatically extracts the date of the news items from the website heading and incorporates it into the HTML output. It also features basic CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the HTML output.
